# 🔍 Retrieval Augmented Generation Engine using LangChain, Streamlit, & Pinecone  
**By Ishita Chitranshi**

## 📖 Overview  

The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Engine is an intelligent system for document retrieval, summarization, and interactive question-answering. This project is built using **LangChain**, **Streamlit**, and **Pinecone** to deliver a smooth and user-friendly web application.

With this tool, you can upload multiple PDF documents, convert their content into vector embeddings, and chat with your documents in real time. The system remembers previous conversations, making interactions more natural and continuous.

## 📝 Problem Statement (Brief)

Many chatbots give generic answers and cannot provide accurate, document-specific information. Users need a system that can answer questions based on their own documents.

This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app using LangChain and Streamlit, allowing users to:

- Upload documents.  
- Convert them into a searchable vector database.  
- Ask questions and get answers grounded in the uploaded content.  
- Interact through an easy-to-use web interface with streaming responses.  

It combines document retrieval + LLM generation to provide context-aware, accurate responses.
